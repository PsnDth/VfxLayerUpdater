Vfx Layer Updater
=================
Will fix all `VfxStats({layer: "front"}, ...)` and convert to the new  `VfxStats({layer: VfxLayer.CHARACTERS_FRONT}, ...)` format.  Any layer string that would not have worked will get commented out. Can either drag the folder onto the button or click it to choose the project folder.

*After selecting, this modifies your project directory!! Be sure to back it up first!*
